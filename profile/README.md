**Welcome to Fallout Community!**


## Why we start it
At the moment, our main goal is to make an application that allows you to collect a roster for a battle mod.

The main difference between our application and the official one is that it will allow us to make changes to maps, prices, etc.

This will allow us to fix the mistakes made by developers and publishers, test new homerules and prepare rosters for local tournaments with custom rules.

Plans also include the creation of an application for the Fallout: Board game  - this will allow you to diversify a small number of encounter cards, make changes to existing scenarios, and even create your own.

## If you want help us
Plese, contact with [Asc0tt](https://github.com/Asc0tt).

Any help is needed, important and appreciated:

* UI design (Draw mockups)
* Testing application, data and UX
* Application backend development (Dart)
* Development of front-end application (Flutter)
* Building and deployment automation (Github CI\CD)
* And of course testing on the table the rules of local communities
